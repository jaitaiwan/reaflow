# Reaflow
Reaflow is a personal project where I'm trying to make the world of coding front-end javascript apps fast and fun. Here's the features I'm working towards:

## Features

1. Touch friendly interface
2. Almost no need to touch actual js code
3. Visual Programming (Like blender's visual programming or [unreal's visual graph programming](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Graphs/))
4. No need for intermediate code. Reaflow will convert projects into AST graphs and display them using the visual programming system. Compilation is just converting ast graphs back to code.
5. Future support for any React component library
6. Future support for react-like libraries (vue.js)
7. Native redux support

## Key Goals

1. Make front-end JS app programming fast and touch friendly
2. Do it in a juicy and beautiful way
3. Produce functional code where possible
4. Be able to build reaflow using reaflow
5. Be able to run reaflow as a desktop app (electron)
6. Make visual graph mode and raw editor modes seamless and realtime (no noticable conversion time between visual grpah -> ast -> js and back)
7. Eventual 100% test coverage

## Contributions

I'd love for the community to get aboard with this project as I think it will benefit everyone and make coding for the creatives in programming quite fun. Coding can be really fun in places like Unreal and blender so why can't we bring this to the web?

I accept contributions in the following forms in order of desirablility and usefulness:

1. Documentation [10-50]
2. Tests [30-45]
3. Bug Fixes [10-25]
